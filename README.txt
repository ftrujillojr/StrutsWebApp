This is a sample struts2 web app.

I am starting out by first trying to incorporate bootstrap plugin.

Items on my list to add:

*  jQuery plugin
*  Interceptor example (possibly login)
*  common controller abstract code.
*  Junit examples
*  AJAX examples
*  JSON plugin routing
* .... many other items.   I will add to the top of this README.txt file when integrated.
